## License: GPLv3
By using this software you agree to the terms in COPYING

## Installation:
 - Install TensorFlow(>1.1), otherwise TensorMol is self-contained.
 - Works on OSX, Ubuntu, and Windows subsystem for Linux:
```
git clone https://github.com/jparkhill/TensorMol.git
cd TensorMol
# If you are using python2x
sudo pip install -e .
# If you are using python3x
sudo pip3 install -e .
python test.py
```

## Timing Information
TensorMol is robust and fast. You can get an BP+electrostatic energy and force of this monstrous cube of 24,000 atoms
in less than 100 seconds on a 2015 MacbookPro (Core i7 2.5Ghz, 16GB mem). Periodic simulations are about 3x
more expensive.

## Usage:
 - ```import TensorMol as tm```
 - We are working on /doc/Tutorials, but it's sparse now.
 - There is also a lot of examples in /samples/test-ZZZ.py and IPython notebooks in /notebooks.
 - IPI interface: start server: ~/i-pi/i-pi samples/i-pi_interface/H2O_cluster.xml > log &; run client: python test_ipi.py

## Sample Results

### Biological molecules
Because Neural network force fields do not rely on any specific atom typing or bond topology, the agony of setting up  simulations of biological molecules is greatly reduced. This gif is a periodic optimization of PDB structure 2EVQ, in explicit polarizable TensorMol solvent.

### Chemical Reactions
Converged nudged elastic band simulations of the cyclization cascade of endiandric acid C (c.f. K. C. Nicolaou, N. A. Petasis, R. E. Zipkin, 1982, The endiandric acid cascade. Electrocyclizations in organic synthesis. 4. Biomimetic approach to endiandric acids A-G. Total synthesis and thermal studies, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 104(20):5560â€“5562).
