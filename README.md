### Sample Results
![IR Spectrum](adenine.PNG) "Adenine IR spectrum generated from test.py > david_testIR()"

### Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/jparkhill/TensorMol.git
cd TensorMol
pip install -e .
python test.py 
```

### Usage:
 - ```import TensorMol as tm```
 - Please also refer to IPython notebooks in /notebooks.

### Requirements:
- Minimum Pre-Requisites: Python2.7x, TensorFlow
- Useful Pre-Requisites: CUDA7.5, PySCF
- To Train Minimally: ~100GB Disk 20GB memory
- To Train Realistically: 1TB Disk, GTX1070++
- To Evaluate: Normal CPU and 10GB Mem

### Common Issues:
- nan during training due to bad checkpoints in /networks (clean.sh)
- Also crashes when reviving networks from disk.
- if you have these issues try:

```
cd C_API/
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
sh clean.sh
```
