By using this software you agree to the terms in COPYING

### Installation:
 - Works on OSX, Ubuntu, and Windows subsystem for Linux.
```
git clone https://github.com/jparkhill/TensorMol.git
cd TensorMol
sudo pip install -e .
python test.py
```

### Usage:
 - ```import TensorMol as tm```
 - TensorMol assumes a directory structure executing path which mirrors the git.
 - Please also refer to IPython notebooks in /notebooks.

### Sample Results

- Water Trimer IR spectrum generated with david_testIR() in test.py
- The red lines are MP2(qchem) solid line is TensorMol's IR propagation.

### Requirements:
- Minimum Pre-Requisites: Python2.7x, TensorFlow
- Useful Pre-Requisites: CUDA7.5, PySCF
- To Train Minimally: ~100GB Disk 20GB memory
- To Train Realistically: 1TB Disk, GTX1070++
- To Evaluate: Normal CPU and 10GB Mem

### Acknowledgements:
 - Google Inc. (for TensorFlow)
 - NVidia Corp. (hardware)

 - Chan Group (for PySCF)

### Common Issues:
- nan during training due to bad checkpoints in /networks (clean.sh)
- Also crashes when reviving networks from disk.
- if you have these issues try re-installing or:

```
sh clean.sh
```
